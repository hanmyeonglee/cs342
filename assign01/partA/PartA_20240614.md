# Part A

## A-1. CSP

### Q1

> Draw the constraint graph over the variables A, B, C, and D.

### Q2

> Imagine we first assign A = p. Cross out eliminated values to show the domains of the variables after forward checking. Note: In this step, you should not treat other variables as newly assigned even if their domain is reduced to a single value.

$D_A = \set{\sout{m}, p} \iff A = p$  
$D_B = \set{t, \sout{f}, \sout{b}} \iff B = t$  
$D_C = \set{st, \sout{r}, h}$  
$D_D = \set{ph, s, d}$

### Q3

> Again imagine we first assign A = p. Cross out eliminated values to show the domains of the variables after arc consistency has been enforced.

$D_A = \set{\sout{m}, p} \iff A = p$  
$D_B = \set{t, \sout{f}, \sout{b}} \iff B = t$  
$D_C = \set{st, \sout{r}, h}$  
$D_D = \set{\sout{ph}, s, d}$

### Q4

> Assume that exactly one value is chosen from the domain of each variable (i.e., one attraction, one boarding option, one cuisine, and one destination memory must be selected). Give at least two solutions for this CSP, or state that none exists.

- Solution #1: $\set{A = p, B = t, C = st, D = s}$  
- Solution #2: $\set{A = p, B = t, C = st, D = ph}$
